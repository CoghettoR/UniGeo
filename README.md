# UniGeo
Adaptation of Tarski's geometry axioms in Unimath.

Experimentations: 

* Using GeoCoq library. See https://github.com/GeoCoq/
* Using the "Makarios version" axioms.
* Using Class or try using methodology (like in Filter.v, Topology,v (UniMath)) to add axioms one by one.
* Try to proof "Satz 2.1, 2.2,...".

unigeo.v: somes results (from unigeo_02.v) verified ("sub/coq/bin/coqide -indices-matter -type-in-type -Q UniMath UniMath").

unigeo_01.v: first experiment, with class and instance. currently temporarily abandoned.
unigeo_02.v: in progress.
