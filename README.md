Experimental:

Adaptation of Tarski's geometry axioms in Unimath.

unigeo.v: somes results verified ("sub/coq/bin/coqide -indices-matter -type-in-type -Q UniMath UniMath" or  coqide -indices-matter -type-in-type unigeo.v)

Experimentations with UniMath:

* Adaptation of Tarski's axioms (GeoCoq library. See https://github.com/GeoCoq/)
* Using the "Makarios version" axioms.
* Try to proof "Satz 2.1, 2.2,...".
